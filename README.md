# Raspberry_Pi_ltb

LTB_Release_Rev0 is the first working release of the state machine implemented in python and verifed functionality of Raspberry Pi4. Spreadsheet format 
is working and formatted as intended. This is the code used for the first-semester demo. Update this description when the code is running on the pizero W.

Rev0 of the Raspberry Pi 4 implementation of the project. The machine functions well and only real-time data written to the spreadsheet needs to be researched and implemented.

Test_Pi_SM_TimeCalcs.py is the latest working state machine with calculations being placed into the spreadsheet. Need to implement "datetime"functions for clarity and improved reporting.
